# toki-jungle-game

This is a simple game to help me figure out how to use the bevy game library for Rust. It is to help me break into making small games for fun and learn something new.
The plan is to make a relatively simple platformer game that involves a person running around a jungle. The end goal is to make it fully fleshed out with splash screens
and a couple different levels.

#TODO - Add thanks to artist I purchased assets from.
