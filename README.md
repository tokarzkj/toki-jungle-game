# toki-jungle-game

This is a simple game to help me figure out how to use the bevy game library for Rust. It is to help me break into making small games for fun and learn something new.
The plan is to make a relatively simple platformer game that involves a person running around a jungle. The end goal is to make it fully fleshed out with splash screens
and a couple different levels.

Thanks to Jesse Munguia! Without this I wouldn't have cool images to build a simple game with.

If you are here to learn proper game design and/or use of the Bevy game engine you have come to the wrong place. I am a web developer trying to branch out and most likely not following best practices along the way.
